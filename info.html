            <strong>Description:</strong><br>
            This is a survival race for two players. The one who scores the most points in 3 rounds wins!<br> 
            To earn points, you need to dodge enemies that will constantly be coming at you.<br> 
            To start the game, select the 'Start' tab and press the Enter key.<br> 
            Next, each player can choose the car they want to play with.<br> 
            There are a total of 4 types of cars in the game, each with its own speed.<br> 
            You can view the specifications in the menu under the 'Garage' tab.<br> 
            The more points players score, the harder the game will become.<br> 
            The speed of the game will continuously increase, and new enemies will appear.<br> 
            I wish you a successful and fun game!<br>
